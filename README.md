# Description

When it comes to buying a house, there is a lot more to consider than just the sticker price. Wages and salaries vary widely across the country, including within specific occupations, as does the share of household income local residents are accustomed to dedicating to housing costs each month. At one extreme, some places with low housing costs might appear to be very affordable, but incomes might also be much lower than elsewhere; at the other extreme, some places that appear to be extremely expensive when looking at prices, might be more manageable as a result of relatively high wages and salaries.

The experts at Zillow have pulled [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) data and combined it with Zillow's [public data](www.zillow.com/research/data). By combining Zillow data on home values, rents, and historical housing costs burdens with data on incomes by occuption from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey, they can compare housing affordability for specific types of workers in different communities across the country. In a tutorial for the [Commerce Data Usability Project](https://www.commerce.gov/datausability), the experts at Zillow have examined where in the United States is housing affordable for our service-people.
